# Pollen-Identification-Project

Hi! Download the code and extract it to a location accessible by jupyter notebook. Make sure the AlteredPollenSlides folder and the PollenIdentificationNotebook are in the same directory.

Essentially, download the zip via the github repo link https://github.com/rmitchellPitzer/Pollen-Identification-Project and extract the contents to a folder and run the notebook there.
